# Arcpanel vs Alternatives

An honest comparison. We're not shy about where Arcpanel leads — and we're upfront about where others still win.

## Where Arcpanel Wins — Massively

**10x lighter** — The panel binaries are ~41MB on disk. At runtime the panel services themselves idle around ~19MB of RAM (measured on a fresh Vultr VPS: agent 12MB + API 7MB), or about ~85MB total with the bundled PostgreSQL. cPanel uses 800MB+. CloudPanel uses 250MB+. On a $5 VPS with 1GB of RAM, that difference is the gap between running your apps and running out of memory.

**Docker integration that no other free panel has** — 152 one-click app templates across 14 categories. Docker Compose stack management. Container logs, shell, stats, resource limits, health checks. Blue-green zero-downtime updates. This is a full container management platform built into a hosting panel. HestiaCP, CloudPanel, and CyberPanel have nothing close to this.

**A complete developer toolkit** — Git push-to-deploy with Nixpacks auto-build (30+ languages, no Dockerfile needed), preview environments with TTL, a full CLI for automation, and Infrastructure as Code (YAML export/import). These are features that RunCloud and Ploi charge $8-15/month for. Arcpanel includes all of them for free.

**Business-ready out of the box** — Multi-server management (unlimited), reseller accounts with quotas and white-label branding, OAuth/SSO (Google, GitHub, GitLab), extension API with HMAC-signed webhooks, migration wizard (import from cPanel/Plesk/HestiaCP), and teams with role-based access. Most panels don't have even half of these at any price.

**Per-image CVE scanning with deploy gating** — No other free Docker-native panel ships this. Every running app is scanned against the Anchore grype vulnerability database, a severity badge surfaces on the Apps list, and a configurable gate refuses new deploys on images with critical/high/medium CVEs. Coolify, Dokploy, Portainer CE, and CyberPanel all leave this to third-party tooling. Arcpanel ships it in the Settings UI, defaults it off, and makes it one click to enable.

**Prometheus-native observability** — A bearer-token-gated `/api/metrics` endpoint emits CPU, memory, disk, GPU utilization/VRAM/temperature/power, site counts, and firing alerts in standard Prometheus exposition format. Drop the generated scrape config block into your `prometheus.yml` and you're done. No other free Docker-native hosting panel ships a Prometheus endpoint — Coolify, Dokploy, Portainer CE, HestiaCP, and CyberPanel all leave this to third-party exporters. The endpoint reads from the existing 30-second metrics collector, so enabling it adds zero per-scrape agent load.

**Signed releases + SBOM out of the box** — Every release binary and SPDX 2.3 SBOM is signed in CI with cosign keyless via Sigstore. There is no long-lived signing key — the certificate is bound to the GitHub Actions OIDC identity of this repository's release workflow and recorded in the public Rekor transparency log. No other free Docker-native panel ships signed releases or per-binary SBOMs. With the EU CRA's supply-chain requirements landing in 2026, this stops being a nice-to-have.

**6 themes, 3 layouts** — Terminal (hacker green), Midnight (navy blue), Ember (warm amber), Arctic (light teal), Clean (light blue SaaS), Clean Dark (GitHub-dark). Three layout options: Sidebar (full nav), Compact (collapsible icon rail), Topbar (horizontal navbar). Every combination works. No other panel lets you personalize the interface like this.

## Where Others Win

**HestiaCP** — Mature, battle-tested, large community. Better for traditional shared hosting setups. Includes its own DNS server (BIND), mail server, and backup system that are proven in production.

**CloudPanel** — Optimized specifically for PHP/Node.js hosting. Simpler interface with fewer features but faster to learn. MySQL/MariaDB management is more polished.

**RunCloud** — SaaS model means zero server maintenance for the panel itself. Their support team handles panel updates and issues. Better for agencies who don't want to self-manage.

**CyberPanel** — Built for OpenLiteSpeed/LiteSpeed. If you need LiteSpeed-specific features (LSCache, QUIC), CyberPanel is the only option.

**Ploi** — Excellent Laravel-specific features. Deep integration with Laravel Forge patterns. Better for Laravel-heavy shops.

## Who Should Use Arcpanel

- **Self-hosters** who want full control without SaaS subscriptions
- **Docker users** who want a GUI for container management alongside traditional hosting
- **Developers** who need Git deploy, CLI, and IaC in a hosting panel
- **Homelab enthusiasts** running ARM64 (Raspberry Pi, Oracle Cloud free tier)
- **Agencies** who need reseller accounts and white-label branding
- **Migration projects** moving from cPanel/Plesk to a modern stack

## Who Should NOT Use Arcpanel

- Teams that need **commercial support SLAs** (we're open source, community-supported)
- Shops committed to **OpenLiteSpeed/LiteSpeed** (use CyberPanel)
- Users who want a **managed SaaS experience** (use RunCloud or Ploi)
- Environments requiring **FIPS compliance** (not yet certified)
