# Changelog

All notable changes to Arcpanel will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [Unreleased] - BREAKING: Arcpanel rebrand

- Binaries: `arc`, `arc-api`, `arc-agent` (was dockpanel, dockpanel-api, dockpanel-agent).
- Paths: `/etc/arcpanel`, `/var/lib/arcpanel`, `/var/run/arcpanel`, `/var/backups/arcpanel`, `/opt/arcpanel`.
- Prometheus: `dockpanel_*` → `arc_*`; scrape tokens now prefix `arcms_` (regenerate panel token).
- Docker: `dockpanel-git-*` / `dockpanel-snapshot:` → `arc-git-*` / `arc-snapshot:`; DB containers `arc-db-*`; labels `arc.*`.
- See docs/guides/migration-dockpanel-to-arcpanel.md.

## [2.7.20] - 2026-04-28

### Security

- **rustls-webpki 0.103.12 → 0.103.13** in both `dockpanel-api` and
  `dockpanel-agent` Cargo locks — fixes `RUSTSEC-2026-0104` (reachable
  panic in CRL parsing). DockPanel calls into rustls-webpki for ACME
  cert verification and pinned-fingerprint TLS (Phase 3 #3 Tier 2), so
  a malformed CRL from a malicious or buggy CA could have crashed the
  process. Patch release, no API changes.
- **postcss 8.5.8 → 8.5.12** in `panel/frontend` and `website/client`
  package locks — fixes `GHSA-7fh5-64p2-3v2j` (XSS via unescaped
  `</style>` in the CSS stringify output). Build-time only; no
  runtime exposure on shipped panels — but worth keeping current.

### Added

- **Servers page: last-seen-at + 24h uptime sparkline.** Each server card
  now shows a small `Last seen 14s ago` line under the IP/status
  subtitle (driven by the existing `last_seen_at` column, refreshed on
  every agent checkin) and a 144-cell horizontal uptime strip — one
  cell per 10-minute bucket over the last 24 hours, derived from
  `metrics_history` row presence. Hover any cell for its time window
  and online/no-data label. New endpoint `GET /api/servers/{id}/uptime`
  returns `{ buckets: bool[], window_hours, bucket_minutes }`. Owner-
  scoped (404 on a server that belongs to a different user); same auth
  shape as the rest of the `/api/servers/*` surface.
- **Pre-built Grafana dashboard (`dashboards/dockpanel-grafana.json`).**
  Drop-in companion to the v2.7.16 Prometheus exporter. Covers fleet
  stats (version / servers reporting / sites / alerts firing by
  severity / GPUs reporting), per-server CPU / memory / disk timeseries
  with sensible thresholds, top-servers bar gauges, sites-by-status
  donut, a collapsible GPUs row (utilization, VRAM%, temperature, power
  draw), and an alerts-firing stacked-bars timeseries. Uses a
  `Datasource` template input so it imports cleanly onto any Prometheus
  that's already scraping `/api/metrics`. UID `dockpanel-fleet` is
  stable so runbook deep-links survive re-imports. A `Server` template
  variable lets operators focus on a single host or any subset. See
  `docs/guides/prometheus.md` "Pre-built Grafana dashboard" for import
  instructions. Closes the Phase 3 #1 follow-up that paired with the
  Prometheus endpoint.
- **Tier 2 cert-pin E2E test suite (`tests/tier2-pin-e2e.sh`).** Covers
  every step of the Phase 3 #3 Tier 2 flow end-to-end against the live
  API: TOFU fingerprint capture on `/api/agent/checkin`, match no-op,
  MITM 403, malformed-fingerprint 400, admin rotate-cert-pin with and
  without the `X-Requested-With` CSRF header, `activity_logs` capture
  of the rotate action, and re-TOFU after rotate. Also includes a
  dedicated regression guard for the v2.7.18 rustls `CryptoProvider`
  panic — it inserts a synthetic online server row with
  `cert_fingerprint` set and a loopback URL with no listener, then
  `POST /api/servers/{id}/test` and asserts status exactly 502
  (graceful connect failure) — a panic would surface as 500 and be
  caught. The suite is self-provisioning: it mints an admin JWT
  locally from `/etc/dockpanel/api.env` when `DOCKPANEL_TEST_PASSWORD`
  is unset, and cleans up all DB rows it creates via an `EXIT` trap.
  Wired into `tests/full-e2e.sh` as a sub-suite at the end of the run.

## [2.7.19] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed

- **Remote-agent TLS pinning no longer panics the API process.** v2.7.18
  shipped the `PinnedFingerprintVerifier` for outbound backend→agent TLS
  but the backend's `main.rs` never installed a process-level rustls
  `CryptoProvider`. On the first request that actually exercised the
  pinned path (i.e. a second server enrolled in the fleet with a
  captured fingerprint), `rustls::ClientConfig::builder()` panicked on
  `CryptoProvider::get_default()`. Pure single-host installs were not
  affected; any multi-server deployment using the pinned verifier was.
  Fix: call `rustls::crypto::aws_lc_rs::default_provider().install_default()`
  at `dockpanel-api` startup (the agent already did this at `main.rs:24`).
  Caught by the v2.7.18 fresh-VPS test before v2.7.18 was declared
  public-ready. No API changes; the Tier 2 part 2 verification flows
  (TOFU capture, MITM 403, rotate-pin, re-TOFU, PinnedFingerprintVerifier
  accept/reject) now all succeed end-to-end.

## [2.7.18] - 2026-04-17

### Added

- **`RemoteAgentClient` cert-pinning enforcement (Phase 3 #3 — Tier 2,
  part 2).** Closes the loop: once an agent's fingerprint has been
  captured by the backend (Tier 2 part 1), every outbound TLS handshake
  to that agent goes through a custom `rustls::client::danger::ServerCertVerifier`
  that only accepts a cert whose DER SHA-256 matches the pinned value.
  Comparison is constant-time via `subtle`; signature verification
  delegates to `rustls::crypto::aws_lc_rs`. When `cert_fingerprint` is
  still NULL for a server (e.g. old agent that doesn't report it), the
  client falls back to the legacy `AGENT_TLS_VERIFY=insecure` env flag
  for backwards compatibility.
  - `AgentRegistry::for_server` now reads `cert_fingerprint` from the
    `servers` row and passes it to `RemoteAgentClient::new_with_pin`.
    Rotating the pin via `POST /api/servers/{id}/rotate-cert-pin` already
    invalidates the cached client (shipped in Tier 2 pt1) so the next
    request rebuilds with the new pin.
- **Agent TLS + cert fingerprint pinning (Phase 3 #3 — Tier 2, part 1).**
  The agent's multi-server listener now terminates TLS instead of shipping
  auth tokens in plaintext, and the central panel captures each agent's
  cert fingerprint on first checkin for later pinning.
  - Agent loads `/etc/dockpanel/ssl/agent.{crt,key}` at startup (generated
    at install time by `install-agent.sh`, or generated on first boot via
    `rcgen` when missing). `AGENT_LISTEN_TCP=0.0.0.0:9443` now binds a
    TLS listener via `axum-server` + `rustls` — the old plaintext bind
    and the `AGENT_ALLOW_INSECURE_BIND` escape hatch are removed, since
    TLS makes the 0.0.0.0 case safe by construction.
  - Agent computes the SHA-256 (hex) fingerprint of its cert at startup,
    logs it on first boot, and includes it in every phone-home checkin.
  - Migration `20260417000000_agent_cert_fingerprint.sql` adds
    `servers.cert_fingerprint` (nullable varchar(64) + partial index).
  - Backend `POST /api/agent/checkin` captures the fingerprint on first
    checkin (Trust On First Use); on subsequent checkins a mismatch is
    rejected with 403 and logged at ERROR level. Format-validated
    (64-char lowercase hex) before storage.
  - New admin endpoint **`POST /api/servers/{id}/rotate-cert-pin`**
    clears the stored fingerprint so the next checkin re-captures. Use
    after a legitimate agent cert rotation or reinstall. Invalidates the
    cached `RemoteAgentClient` and writes an audit log entry.
  - Servers page gains a per-server TLS pin row showing the shortened
    fingerprint (first 16 / last 16 chars, full hash on hover) and a
    "Rotate pin" button with an inline confirmation bar.
  - Pt2 (pin-enforcement in `RemoteAgentClient`) ships in the same
    release — see the first bullet above.
- **Unified fleet-wide backup view (Phase 3 #3 — Tier 1).** The Backup
  Orchestrator page gains an **All Backups** tab that lists site, database,
  and volume backups from every server in a single paginated table, with
  optional filters by server and by kind.
  - New admin endpoint **`GET /api/backup-orchestrator/all`** joins
    `backups`, `database_backups`, and `volume_backups` via a UNION CTE
    and resolves `server_id` to a server name (site backups derive their
    server from `sites.server_id`; database and volume backups carry the
    column directly). Query params: `limit`, `offset`, `kind`
    (`site`|`database`|`volume`), `server_id`. Returns `{ items, total }`.
  - Per-row badges surface `encrypted` (at-rest encryption enabled) and
    `remote` (pushed to a backup destination) so fleet admins can spot
    inconsistencies at a glance.
  - Closes the last missing north-star bullet for "Operate at Scale":
    agent enrollment and cross-host placement were already shipped
    (`ServerScope` + `servers` table + `install-agent.sh`); the unified
    backup view was the remaining gap.

## [2.7.17] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- **2026-ready ACME (Phase 3 #2 — Tier 1).** DockPanel is now ready for
  Let's Encrypt's May 13 2026 `tlsserver` → 45-day flip, the existing 6-day
  `shortlived` profile, and the Feb 2027 / Feb 2028 `classic` reductions.
  - **RFC 9773 ARI-driven renewal.** The auto-healer now queries the CA's
    ACME Renewal Information for each cert and honours the suggested
    renewal window instead of a hard-coded 30-day threshold. Falls back to
    a profile-aware margin (2d / 15d / 30d) when a CA doesn't advertise
    ARI. New columns `sites.ssl_renewal_at`, `sites.ssl_renewal_checked_at`.
  - **ACME profile selection UI.** Settings → ACME Profile lets admins
    pick the default profile (`classic` / `tlsserver` / `shortlived`) for
    all new certificates. List auto-populates from the CA's server
    directory; card hides itself if the CA doesn't advertise the profiles
    extension. New column `sites.ssl_profile` stores which profile issued
    each cert.
  - **Force-renew migrated off certbot CLI.** `/api/ssl/{id}/renew` now
    issues via `instant_acme` and passes the previous cert as the ARI
    `replaces` hint, so the CA sees a continuous issuance chain. Legacy
    certbot-issued certs no longer trigger spurious failures on renew.
  - **`/api/ssl/profiles`** (admin) lists CA-advertised profiles with
    descriptions. **`/api/ssl/default-profile`** (admin) sets or clears the
    panel-wide default. **`/ssl/{domain}/renewal-info`** (agent) exposes
    the raw ARI suggestion per cert.

### Changed

- Auto-heal SSL copy in Settings replaced stale "3 days" threshold
  language with accurate ARI + profile-aware explanation.
- DNS-PERSIST-01 (Q2 2026) intentionally deferred — no Let's Encrypt
  production date yet; will land once instant-acme exposes the draft API.

## [2.7.16] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- **Prometheus `/api/metrics` scrape endpoint (Phase 3 #1).** Hand-formatted
  exposition text — no extra crate, respects the lightness axis. Gated by a
  SHA-256-hashed scrape token (constant-time compare via `subtle`); returns
  404 when disabled so an off panel doesn't advertise a scrape surface.
  Exposes `dockpanel_info`, per-server cpu/memory/disk percents, per-GPU
  utilization / VRAM / temperature / power, per-status site counts, and
  alerts firing by severity. New `PrometheusSettings` card in Settings
  with auto-generated token, reveal-once banner, rotate button, and a
  copy-ready `prometheus.yml` scrape_configs block.

## [2.7.15] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- **GPU history + alerts (Phase 2 #2).** Historical GPU charts in System
  (utilization, VRAM, temperature, power). Alert engine gains GPU-aware
  rules: VRAM > 90%, temp > 85°C, utilization pinned at 100% for 15 min.
- **Ollama model management + vLLM picker + idle-unload (Phase 2 #3).**

### Changed

- **CI on Actions Node 24.** Upgraded action pins to their Node-24-ready
  versions, including `sigstore/cosign-installer@v4.1.1` (no floating v4
  tag exists). `cargo install cargo-sbom` is now called with `--force` so
  restoring a cached `~/.cargo/bin/` doesn't break the release workflow.

## [2.7.14] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed

- **`scripts/update.sh` now self-refreshes from the latest release tag.**
  The v2.7.13 fix to the rollback bug only helped operators who manually
  refreshed their on-disk copy of update.sh, because update.sh wasn't
  in the binary release tarball and never overwrote itself during an
  upgrade. v2.7.14 closes the chicken-and-egg: when run with
  `INSTALL_FROM_RELEASE=1`, update.sh fetches the latest tag's
  `scripts/update.sh` from raw.githubusercontent.com, replaces its own
  on-disk copy if it differs, and re-execs. A `SELF_REFRESHED=1` env
  guard prevents infinite loops.

  **Operators currently stuck on v2.7.11 or v2.7.12** (where the broken
  health check rolls every upgrade back) need to bootstrap once:
  ```
  sudo curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ovexro/dockpanel/main/scripts/update.sh \
       -o /opt/dockpanel/scripts/update.sh
  sudo INSTALL_FROM_RELEASE=1 bash /opt/dockpanel/scripts/update.sh
  ```
  After the first successful upgrade, future runs self-refresh
  automatically.

## [2.7.13] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed

- **`scripts/update.sh` rolled back every upgrade** — the post-deploy
  health check POSTed to `/api/auth/setup-status`, but that endpoint is
  GET-only and returned 405 Method Not Allowed on every run, triggering
  the rollback path even when the new binaries were healthy. Caught by
  the v2.7.12 fresh-VPS test (the first end-to-end `update.sh` exercise
  in several releases). Operators on v2.7.11 or v2.7.12 who pulled via
  `update.sh` would have been silently held back; manual re-pull or
  reinstall via `install.sh` was unaffected. Fix: switch the check to
  GET.

## [2.7.12] - 2026-04-15

### Added

- **Per-container GPU assignment.** Multi-GPU hosts can now pin specific
  NVIDIA devices to specific containers — pin Ollama to GPU 0, vLLM to
  GPU 1, Stable Diffusion to GPU 2. The deploy form auto-detects available
  GPUs (via the existing `/apps/gpu-info`) and shows a multi-select picker
  on hosts with two or more devices. Single-GPU hosts keep the original
  simple toggle. Backed by Docker's `DeviceRequest.device_ids`; assignment
  persists across `update_app()` recreations because Docker preserves the
  host_config when pulling a new image.
- **vLLM template (AI / Machine Learning).** High-throughput, memory-
  efficient LLM inference server with an OpenAI-compatible API. Defaults
  to `meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct` and accepts an optional
  `HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN` for gated models. Fills the most-glaring AI
  template gap (the inference-engine peer to Ollama).
- **`gpu_recommended` flag on app templates.** Templates that materially
  benefit from GPU passthrough (Ollama, LocalAI, vLLM, Stable Diffusion
  WebUI, Text Generation WebUI, Whisper) now ship a flag that surfaces a
  small "GPU" badge on the template card and pre-ticks the GPU passthrough
  toggle on the deploy form. Frontends/orchestrators (Open WebUI,
  LiteLLM, Flowise, Langflow, Dify) intentionally remain unflagged.

### Changed

- **LocalAI default image switched to GPU variant.**
  `localai/localai:latest-cpu` → `localai/localai:latest-gpu-nvidia-cuda-12`.
  The previous default silently ignored the GPU passthrough toggle on
  every deploy. Operators on CPU-only hosts can switch back via the Image
  field on the deploy form.
- **Text Generation WebUI pinned** from `:default-nightly` to `:default`
  so shipped deploys don't drift on rebuild.

### Public

- **dockpanel.dev/security launched.** Public security posture page —
  audit count, signed-releases / SBOM story, response SLA, all 7 audit
  rounds with headline fixes, recent advisories, defense-in-depth grid,
  vulnerability-report CTA. Counter-positions DockPanel against the
  Coolify/CyberPanel narratives. Linked from main nav (between Compare
  and Pricing) and footer Product column. SECURITY.md cross-references
  the page at the top.

## [2.7.11] - 2026-04-15

### Added

- **Per-image SBOM generation (syft).** Second half of the Phase 1 supply-chain
  story (after v2.7.10's signed releases). Generate an SPDX 2.3 JSON SBOM for
  any deployed Docker app's image — the composition companion to image
  vulnerability scanning. Defaults to **off**; admins opt in from
  Settings → Services → SBOM Generation.
  - **Install button** pulls Anchore's signed syft installer into
    `/var/lib/dockpanel/scanners/syft` (same self-contained, sandbox-safe
    pattern as grype — works under `ProtectSystem=strict`).
  - **Download SBOM button** in each app's scan drawer. Click runs syft against
    the app's image (10 – 60 s on first generation), persists the SPDX
    document, and triggers a browser download of `<app>.spdx.json`.
  - **Persistence** — `image_sbom` table holds one row per image, overwritten
    on regeneration. Stored as JSONB so the API serves the SPDX document
    directly without re-parsing on the agent.
  - **API surface** mirrors `/api/image-scan/...` shape:
    `/api/sbom/{settings,install,uninstall,generate,image/{ref}}` plus
    `/api/apps/{name}/sbom` for both POST (generate) and GET (download).
  - **Agent image-ref validator** rejects shell metacharacters before invoking
    syft — defence-in-depth against shell-injection via user-supplied refs.

This is the operator-facing half: every container running on the panel now has
a one-click supply-chain artifact to satisfy compliance asks (EU CRA Sep 2026)
and to feed external tooling like Dependency-Track or Grype-on-SBOM.

## [2.7.10] - 2026-04-15

### Added

- **Signed releases via cosign keyless (Sigstore).** Every binary and SBOM in
  the GitHub release is now signed in CI using the release workflow's OIDC
  identity — no long-lived signing key exists, and every signature is recorded
  in the public Rekor transparency log. Verification snippet in
  [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#verifying-release-signatures).
- **Per-binary SPDX 2.3 SBOMs.** `cargo-sbom` runs in CI for the agent, API,
  and CLI crates, emitting `dockpanel-{agent,api,cli}.spdx.json` alongside the
  binaries (also signed). Local builds via `scripts/release.sh` now generate
  SBOMs too; signing remains CI-only so the OIDC-bound certificate identity is
  always traceable to this repository's release workflow.

This is the first half of the Phase 1 supply-chain story — the next release
exposes per-deployed-container SBOMs in-panel.

## [2.7.9] - 2026-04-15

### Added

- **Per-image vulnerability scanning (grype).** First feature in the Phase 1
  "Trust by Default" cycle. Scans every Docker app's image for known CVEs and
  surfaces a severity badge per app row on the Apps page, next to the existing
  update badge. Click a row to see the full CVE table (CVE ID, severity,
  package, installed version, fixed version). Defaults to **off** so existing
  installs see no behaviour change on upgrade — admins opt in from
  Settings → Services → Image Vulnerability Scanning.
  - **Install button** pulls Anchore's signed grype installer into
    `/var/lib/dockpanel/scanners/` (self-contained — doesn't pollute
    `/usr/local/bin` and works under the hardened agent sandbox). The
    vulnerability database primes during install.
  - **Scheduled scans** rescan every running app's image in the background at
    a configurable interval (default 24h, range 1–720h).
  - **Soft deploy gate** refuses new deploys if the template's image has a
    recent scan exceeding a threshold (`critical` / `high` / `medium`). First
    encounter of an image triggers a best-effort background scan so the next
    deploy enforces the gate without blocking the first one.
  - **Scan-on-demand** from the per-app drawer. Ad-hoc scan of any image via
    `POST /api/image-scan/scan`.
  - **Agent image-ref validator** rejects shell metacharacters before invoking
    grype — defence-in-depth against shell-injection via user-supplied image
    references.

### Fixed

- **`/var/lib/dockpanel` was missing from the hardened agent sandbox's
  `ReadWritePaths`.** Audit 7 introduced `ProtectSystem=strict` on the agent
  unit file (`panel/agent/dockpanel-agent.service`) but only listed
  `/etc/nginx`, `/etc/dockpanel`, `/var/run/dockpanel`, `/var/backups/dockpanel`,
  `/var/www`, `/var/log`, `/etc/letsencrypt` — which meant git builds, terminal
  recordings, mail backups, Docker app volumes, and the new image scanner would
  all have silently failed if anyone deployed the hardened unit verbatim. Added
  `/var/lib/dockpanel` to the path list. (Installer scripts still emit
  `ProtectSystem=no` units, so fresh installs from `install.sh` / `update.sh`
  were not affected.)

## [2.7.8] - 2026-04-15

### Security (Audit Round 7)
- **tar backups now use `--no-dereference`** — full-site backups, WordPress
  pre-update snapshots, and mailbox archives no longer follow symlinks inside
  the site root. A symlink pointed at `/etc` would previously have been
  archived as the target's content.
- **Cron command filter explicitly rejects `\n` and `\r`** — was implicit
  before; defense-in-depth against scheduled-job newline injection.
- **Web-terminal command blocklist extended** — `chroot`, `pivot_root`,
  `capsh`, `mknod`, `debugfs`, `kexec` added to the pattern list.
- **Agent systemd unit hardened** — `ProtectKernelTunables`,
  `ProtectControlGroups`, `ProtectClock`, `ProtectHostname`, `RestrictRealtime`,
  `RestrictSUIDSGID`, `LockPersonality`, `RestrictNamespaces=~CLONE_NEWUSER`.
- **Frontend URL guards** — Telemetry's update-release link and the public
  status page's operator-supplied logo URL now require `http(s)://` schemes,
  blocking `javascript:` / `data:` URLs routed through backend-controlled
  config fields.

### Fixed
- **Security-scan alert pileup eliminated.** The weekly security scanner fired
  a new alert on every run without resolving prior firing alerts, so
  unacknowledged alerts compounded and the escalation loop re-notified every
  2–5 minutes. New scans now auto-resolve prior firing/acknowledged security
  alerts before firing their own result.

### Improved
- **README / COMPARISON / docs RAM claim updated** — previous "~57MB" figure
  was stale. Fresh Vultr VPS measurement: panel services alone idle at ~19 MB
  (agent 12 MB + API 7 MB), or ~85 MB including the bundled PostgreSQL.
  Landing-page RAM bar now shows 19 MB.

## [2.7.7] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- **File Manager uploads were silently broken.** The wired agent upload handler
  expected `{path, content_base64}` while the backend (and frontend) sent
  `{path, filename, content}`. A second handler in `agent/routes/files.rs` had
  the right shape but was never wired to a router. Fixed the wired handler to
  accept the real payload (with `content_base64` alias for backwards
  compatibility) and removed the orphan duplicate.
- **Per-site PHP-FPM pool config changes never took effect.** Agent called
  `write_php_pool_config(...)` but never reloaded PHP-FPM afterwards, so custom
  `php_memory_mb` / `php_max_workers` per site were ignored until a manual
  restart. Wired `reload_php_fpm` right after the pool write.
- **Installer silently fell back to IP-only mode over non-interactive SSH.**
  Piping `install.sh` through an SSH session with no controlling tty made
  `read < /dev/tty` fail silently and cleared `PANEL_DOMAIN`. Now prints a
  clear "no tty — set PANEL_DOMAIN to configure" notice and points at the
  env var.
- **`/var/lib/dockpanel/recordings` was never created on fresh install.** The
  terminal-recording API and auto-healer retention sweep both reference it.
  Added to the installer's `mkdir -p` list.

### Removed
- Agent dead code: `restart_app_service`, `app_service_status`, `build_labels`,
  `connect_to_network` (Docker-label routing superseded by file-provider
  `write_route_config`), `volume_backup::get_backup_path` (duplicate), and
  `BackupInfo::new`.

## [2.7.6] - 2026-04-14

### Improved
- **Complete UX polish pass** — all remaining 12 pages reviewed and polished
- Mail: success feedback for alias/backup delete, queue error handling, logs loading skeleton
- Security: all raw Tailwind colors replaced with design system tokens (lockdown, audit log, approvals)
- Settings: success feedback for destination delete, API key revoke, lockdown threshold save; SSH key error handling; empty states for SSH keys and IP whitelist
- Monitors: success feedback for create/toggle/delete operations
- IncidentManagement: inline delete confirmations (was direct delete), success feedback, settings tab empty state
- WordPressToolkit: success banner for bulk update and hardening actions
- Telemetry: fix unsafe error casts, fix version display bug (`vundefined`), color consistency
- Login: loading spinner instead of blank page during auth check
- Integrations: loading skeletons for WHMCS and Migrations tabs
- NexusLayout: add missing incident count badge (consistent with other 3 layouts)
- Color consistency: `emerald`/`green`/`red` → `rust`/`danger` design tokens across 5 files

### Removed
- **Zero `any`** remaining in entire frontend (37 new TypeScript interfaces, completed in v2.7.5 cycle)

### Security
- Updated `rand` 0.9.2 → 0.9.4 (fixes 2 low-severity Dependabot alerts — soundness with custom loggers)

## [2.7.5] - 2026-04-14

### Improved
- **Systematic UX polish** across 20+ frontend pages
- All `confirm()` dialogs (25) replaced with inline confirmation bars across 5 files
- All `prompt()` calls (6) replaced with inline input forms across 5 files
- All `console.error/warn/log` removed from frontend page components
- All `bg-rust-50` light-mode colors replaced with dark-mode-compatible `bg-rust-500/10` (8 files)
- SiteDetail: loading skeletons for traffic stats, PHP extensions, access logs; WAF empty state
- Databases: success feedback for create/delete/PITR toggle; typed SchemaBrowser generics
- File Manager: save success indicator, Ctrl+S keyboard shortcut
- DNS: 16 `any` type casts replaced with 5 proper TypeScript interfaces

### Security
- Upgraded `rand` 0.8 → 0.9.3 (fixes 2 Dependabot security alerts)
- Upgraded `vite` 6.4.1 → 6.4.2 (fixes 2 high + 2 medium Dependabot alerts)

### Added
- Git hooks: pre-commit (infrastructure leak scan), pre-push (secrets + frontend staleness + version consistency)
- Scripts: `docs-audit.sh`, `release.sh` (x86_64 + ARM64 cross-compile), `deploy-check.sh`

## [2.7.4] - 2026-04-03

### Security
- JWT role staleness: sessions now invalidated immediately on role change (was stale up to 2h)
- Webhook gateway DNS rebinding SSRF: destination URL re-validated at forward time, not just registration
- Agent checkin replay prevention: timestamp validation rejects requests >120s old
- Per-user ACME rate limiting: max 10 SSL certificates per hour per user (HTTP-01 and DNS-01)
- DNS pre-flight check: verify domain resolves to this server's IP before HTTP-01 provisioning
- Request timeout: 300s TimeoutLayer added as defense-in-depth against slow requests
- Agent response streaming limit: uses `http_body_util::Limited` instead of buffering entire response before size check

## [2.6.5] - 2026-03-25

### Security
- **Research-driven security audit**: Studied CVEs from CyberPanel, HestiaCP, CloudPanel, VestaCP, Webmin, cPanel — then audited DockPanel against those attack patterns. 55 findings (12 HIGH, 28 MEDIUM, 15 LOW).
- **Command execution safety**: Added `safe_command()` module — `env_clear()` on all 341 `Command::new()` calls across 44 files. Prevents LD_PRELOAD/PATH hijacking.
- **Credential encryption at rest**: All stored credentials (DB passwords, SMTP, S3/SFTP, OAuth, TOTP, DKIM) encrypted with AES-256-GCM using dedicated key derivation.
- **Shell injection fix**: Rewrote database_backup.rs — piped `docker exec` + `gzip` instead of `bash -c` with interpolated strings.
- **Tar symlink attacks**: `--no-dereference` on backup creation, `--no-same-owner` on restore.
- **Session revocation**: `revoke_all_sessions` now actually works — auth middleware checks cached timestamp.
- **Deploy log IDOR**: Ownership verification on both git_deploys and docker_apps SSE streams.
- **Content Security Policy**: Added CSP header to frontend nginx config.
- **Docker exec denylist**: Added 7 escape-relevant commands (unshare, pivot_root, setns, capsh, mknod, debugfs, kexec).
- **Compose volume symlinks**: `canonicalize()` resolves symlinks before path validation.
- **nginx header inheritance**: Security headers re-declared in static asset location blocks.

## [2.6.1] - 2026-03-22

### Added (LOW Priority Gap Fixes)
- **Domain rename** — New `PUT /api/sites/{id}/domain` endpoint to rename a site's domain. Agent handler renames nginx config, site directory, SSL certs, log files, PHP-FPM pools, Fail2Ban jails, redirects, and htpasswd configs. Backend updates monitors, status page components, and logs activity
- **Auto-firewall for proxy ports** — Sites created with proxy/node/python runtime automatically get a UFW deny rule blocking external access to the allocated proxy port (traffic only allowed through nginx). Rule is auto-removed on site deletion
- **Laravel auto-migrations** — Site deploys for Laravel sites (`php_preset = "laravel"`) now auto-run `php artisan migrate --force` after successful deploy
- **One-time scheduled deploy** — New `POST /api/git-deploys/{id}/schedule` endpoint to schedule a deploy at a specific time. New `scheduled_deploy_at` column on `git_deploys`. Deploy scheduler checks for due one-time schedules every 60s and auto-clears after triggering. Cancel with `DELETE /api/git-deploys/{id}/schedule`
- **Change Docker app image** — New `PUT /api/apps/{container_id}/image` endpoint to change a running container's image tag. Pulls new image, stops old container, creates new one preserving volumes, rolls back on failure
- **Update Docker app resource limits** — New `PUT /api/apps/{container_id}/limits` endpoint to update CPU/memory limits on running containers via `docker update`. Accepts `memory_mb` and `cpu_percent`

## [2.6.0] - 2026-03-22

### Fixed (Automation Gap Audit — Priority 1)
- **Auto-SSL DB update** — Background SSL provisioning now updates `ssl_enabled`, `ssl_cert_path`, `ssl_key_path`, `ssl_expiry` in the database and activates paused monitors (was silently succeeding without DB update)
- **Auto-SSL config preservation** — SSL provisioning now passes `php_preset` and `root_path` to the agent, preventing custom nginx config from being wiped
- **Pre-deploy backup** — All deploy paths (site deploy, git deploy manual, git deploy webhook/scheduled) now create a site backup before deploying
- **Pre-delete backup** — Site deletion creates a final backup before CASCADE-deleting the site record
- **Site deletion cleanup** — Now removes orphaned `status_page_components` matching the deleted domain
- **Database restore** — New `POST /db-backups/{db_name}/restore/{filename}` agent endpoint + `POST /api/backup-orchestrator/db-backups/{id}/restore` API endpoint. Supports MySQL/MariaDB, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB restore from backup files
- **Dashboard health score** — Now factors in backup freshness (-5 per stale site), security scan findings (-10 critical, -3 warning), and open incidents (-10 each)

- **Alert escalation** — Unacknowledged firing alerts re-notify with `[ESCALATED]` prefix after 15 minutes, then every 30 minutes. New `escalated_at` column + migration
- **Alert-to-incident correlation** — Before creating a new incident from an alert, checks for existing active incidents within 5 minutes. Appends as incident update instead of creating duplicates
- **Auto-healer restart limit** — Tracks restart count per service over 30-minute window. After 3 failed restarts, stops healing, creates critical incident, sends notification, and marks state as `exhausted`
- **Disk-full forecast alerting** — Computes disk fill rate from metrics history; alerts when disk projected full within 48h (critical if <12h)
- **Memory leak trend detection** — Compares recent vs older memory averages; warns when sustained >10% increase with usage above 60%
- **Docker container crash detection** — New `check_container_health` in alert engine detects exited, crash-looping, and unhealthy containers
- **Docker container auto-restart** — Auto-healer restarts exited/dead Docker containers with same 3-attempt limit as system services
- **Incidents pause deploys** — All 5 deploy paths (manual site, webhook site, manual git, webhook git, scheduled git) check for active critical/major incidents before proceeding
- **Security scanner auto-fix** — Auto-renews expiring SSL certificates detected by security scans (safe findings only, never auto-deletes)
- **Fail2Ban auto-configuration** — New sites auto-get a Fail2Ban jail monitoring their access log; removed on site deletion
- **Session management** — New `user_sessions` table, `GET /api/auth/sessions` (list with is_current flag), `DELETE /api/auth/sessions/{id}` (revoke), auto-cleanup of expired sessions
- **Notification center** — Bell icon with unread badge in all 4 layouts. New `panel_notifications` table, 4 API endpoints (list, unread-count, mark-read, mark-all-read), `/notifications` page with severity colors. Alerts auto-insert into notification center. 30-day retention cleanup. SSE real-time delivery. Wired into 18 event sources (deploys, incidents, backups, security, SSL, auto-healer, sites, auth)

### Fixed (Automation Gap Audit — MEDIUM Priority, 25 gaps)
- **Clone site auto-provisioning** — Clone now triggers auto-backup schedule, secrets vault, status page component, and site.created event
- **Composite site health** — New `GET /api/sites/{id}/health-summary` combining SSL, backup freshness, uptime, and composite score

- **Generic webhook notifications** — New `notify_webhook_url` in alert rules for custom integrations (Telegram, Teams, etc.)
- **Weekly digest email** — Monday morning summary with 7-day alert/backup/incident/deploy counts to all admins
- **Post-deploy cache invalidation** — Nginx cache purge after successful deploy (fastcgi + proxy cache)
- **Reseller branding** — `GET /api/branding` now returns per-reseller logo/colors/name when applicable
- **Unified event timeline** — New `GET /api/dashboard/timeline` merging deploys, backups, incidents, alerts, scans

## [2.5.2] - 2026-03-22

### Fixed (Theme & Layout Consistency Audit)
- **Clean-Dark rounding parity** — Added ~120 lines of structural overrides (cards, modals, tables, buttons, scrollbar, selection, focus rings, progress bars, code blocks) so Clean-Dark has round corners everywhere, matching Clean
- **Ember radius normalized** — `--radius-xl` and `--radius-2xl` were 2px smaller than all other themes; fixed to 16px/20px
- **Clean hardcoded border-radius → CSS variables** — All 11 instances of hardcoded `12px/8px/6px/4px` converted to `var(--radius-lg/md/sm/xs)` for theme consistency
- **Status dot glow per-theme** — Green glow was hardcoded for all themes; now uses theme-appropriate accent color (blue for Midnight/Clean-Dark, orange for Ember, teal for Arctic, blue for Clean)
- **Progress bar glow for Arctic & Clean** — Missing glow rules added for both light themes
- **Settings theme picker missing `data-color-scheme`** — Switching to light themes now correctly sets color scheme attribute
- **Default theme mismatch** — Settings.tsx fallback aligned to `midnight` (was `terminal`)
- **FOUC prevention** — Added inline script in index.html to apply theme before CSS loads
- **LayoutSwitcher light variant** — Replaced hardcoded `zinc/blue/white` colors with theme variables
- **2FA banner in all layouts** — Replaced `amber-*` (stock Tailwind) with `warn-*` (theme tokens)

- **Compact layout footer spacing** — Removed nested padding wrapper, aligned `px-3` to match Sidebar layout spacing
- **Layout switcher dropdown redesign** — Added `p-1` padding and `rounded-md` items to match panel dropdown style; compact mode hides label text to save space; removed bordered button style for cleaner ghost-button look

## [2.5.1] - 2026-03-22

### Fixed (Remaining 7 Gaps — Phase D)
- **GAP 7+21: Internal events bridge to webhook gateway** — `fire_event()` now also forwards events to webhook gateway routes with `filter_path=/event` and `filter_value={event_type}`. Users can subscribe gateway routes to any internal event.
- **GAP 12: Docker apps auto-get monitor + status component** — Docker apps deployed with a domain now auto-create an HTTP monitor and a status page component under "Docker Apps" group.
- **GAP 13: Git deploy auto-creates gateway endpoint** — New git deploys auto-create a webhook gateway endpoint for webhook inspection/replay capabilities.

- **GAP 17: Vault export/import** — New `GET /api/secrets/vaults/{id}/export` and `POST /api/secrets/vaults/{id}/import` endpoints for encrypted vault backup and transfer between DockPanel instances.

### Automation Audit: Complete
All 21 identified gaps now addressed. Zero manual steps required for: backup scheduling, uptime monitoring, secret injection, incident creation, status page updates, or webhook delivery.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-03-22

### Fixed (21-Gap Automation Audit)
- **GAP 1: Backup policies now execute** — New `backup_policy_executor` background service runs every 60s, evaluates cron schedules, executes backup policies across sites, databases, and volumes. Policies are no longer dead config.
- **GAP 2: Verifier respects policy_id** — Backup verifier checks `verify_after_backup` flag. Policy executor triggers verification after successful backups.
- **GAP 3: Auto-incidents from monitoring** — When a monitor goes down, the system auto-creates a managed incident with timeline, links affected status page components, and auto-resolves when the monitor recovers.
- **GAP 4: Auto status page components** — New sites automatically get a status page component (if status page is enabled).
- **GAP 5: Auto-inject secrets on deploy** — After a successful deploy, the system checks for a linked vault with `auto_inject` secrets and injects them into the site's `.env` file automatically.
- **GAP 6: Auto-vault for new sites** — Every new site gets an auto-created secrets vault linked via `site_id`.
- **GAP 8: fire_event in all new features** — Backup orchestrator, incident management, and secrets manager now emit extension webhook events (`db_backup.created`, `incident.created`, `secrets.injected`, etc.).
- **GAP 9: Critical alerts create incidents** — Critical alerts and server offline/service down alerts auto-create managed incidents visible on the status page.
- **GAP 10: Backup failure creates incident** — When a backup policy has failures, a managed incident is auto-created.
- **GAP 14: Backup for ALL sites** — Removed the `site_count <= 1` gate. Every new site now gets a daily backup schedule automatically.
- **GAP 15: Auto-monitor with deferred activation** — New sites get a paused HTTP monitor that auto-activates after successful SSL provisioning (when DNS is confirmed working).
- **GAP 18: Webhook delivery cleanup** — Added 7-day retention cleanup for `webhook_deliveries` and 90-day for `backup_verifications` in the auto-healer retention cycle.
- **GAP 19: Subscribers notified of auto-downtime** — Status page subscribers now receive email notifications when monitors detect downtime, not just for manually-created incidents.
- **GAP 20: Policy encrypt flag works** — The backup policy executor passes the encrypt flag through to agent backup endpoints when `encrypt = TRUE`.

### Infrastructure
- New background service: `backup_policy_executor` (supervised, 60s interval) — 11th background service
- Modified: `uptime.rs` (auto-incidents + subscriber notifications), `alert_engine.rs` (critical→incident), `sites.rs` (auto-vault, auto-monitor, auto-component, backup for all), `ssl.rs` (activate monitors), `deploy.rs` (auto-inject secrets), `auto_healer.rs` (retention cleanup), `backup_orchestrator.rs` + `incidents.rs` + `secrets.rs` (fire_event calls)

  - **Vault sidebar UI**: Split-pane layout with vault list on left, secrets table on right. Create/edit/delete with inline forms.
  - **E2E test suite**: `tests/secrets-manager-e2e.sh` — vault CRUD, secret CRUD, encryption roundtrip, version history, pull.

### Infrastructure
- New crate dependencies: `aes-gcm 0.10`, `base64 0.22` for AES-256-GCM encryption.
- New service: `secrets_crypto.rs` — encrypt/decrypt with nonce+ciphertext format, unit tests included.

  - **Overall status indicator**: Automatically computed from component health (operational/degraded/major outage).
  - **Incident history**: Shows active incidents with full timeline, plus resolved incidents within configurable history window.
  - **Auto-detected downtime**: Legacy monitor-based incidents also displayed for complete visibility.
  - **Email subscribers**: Public subscribe/unsubscribe for incident notifications. Verified subscribers receive updates on status changes.
  - **Standalone public page**: Dark-themed, no-auth status page at `/status` with responsive layout.
- **Admin UI**: New "Incidents" page in Operations nav with 3 tabs (Incidents, Components, Settings).
- **11 new API endpoints**: Incidents CRUD + updates, status page config, components CRUD, subscribers, enhanced public endpoint.
- **E2E test suite**: `tests/incident-management-e2e.sh` covering full incident lifecycle, components, public page, subscribers.

### Infrastructure
- New migration: `status_page_config`, `status_page_components`, `status_page_component_monitors`, `managed_incidents`, `managed_incident_components`, `incident_updates`, `status_page_subscribers` tables.
- Frontend: `IncidentManagement.tsx` (admin), `PublicStatusPage.tsx` (public standalone).

## [2.1.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **Backup Orchestrator**: New centralized backup management system for databases, Docker volumes, and sites.
  - **Database backups**: MySQL/MariaDB (`mysqldump`), PostgreSQL (`pg_dump`), and MongoDB (`mongodump`) dump + restore via Docker exec. Compressed with gzip.
  - **Docker volume backups**: Back up any Docker volume to `.tar.gz` using a temporary Alpine container. Restore volumes with one click.
  - **Encryption at rest**: Optional AES-256-CBC encryption (PBKDF2, 100k iterations) for all backup types via OpenSSL. Encrypted files get `.enc` suffix, originals are auto-deleted.
  - **Automatic restore verification**: Verify backups by spinning up temporary database containers and restoring dumps, or extracting archives to temp directories. Checks file integrity, table counts, and entry points.
  - **Backup policies**: Cross-resource policies with cron scheduling, destination selection, retention count, encryption toggle, and auto-verification.
  - **Backup health dashboard**: Global overview with total counts, storage usage, 24h success/failure rates, active policies, verification stats, and stale backup warnings.
  - **Background verifier**: Supervised service running every 6 hours that automatically verifies unverified backups and fires alerts on failures.
  - **B2 and GCS destinations**: Backblaze B2 and Google Cloud Storage now supported as backup destinations (S3-compatible API).
  - **CLI commands**: `dockpanel backup db-create`, `db-list`, `vol-create`, `vol-list`, `verify`, `health` — full backup management from the command line.
  - **E2E test suite**: Dedicated backup orchestrator test script (`tests/backup-orchestrator-e2e.sh`) covering health, policies CRUD, database backup lifecycle with verification.
- **Nav item**: "Backups" in Operations section links to the new Backup Orchestrator page.

### Infrastructure
- New migration: `backup_policies`, `database_backups`, `volume_backups`, `backup_verifications` tables.
- Extended `backup_destinations` with `encryption_enabled`, `encryption_key` columns, and B2/GCS dtype support.
- Agent: 4 new services (`database_backup`, `volume_backup`, `encryption`, `backup_verify`) + 3 new route modules.
- Backend: `backup_orchestrator` routes (11 endpoints), `backup_verifier` supervised background service.
- Frontend: `BackupOrchestrator.tsx` page with 5 tabs (Overview, Policies, DB Backups, Volume Backups, Verifications).

## [2.0.6] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed
- **Nexus themes decoupled from layout**: Nexus and Nexus Dark themes were previously locked to the Nexus layout only. They are now independent color themes that work with any layout (Terminal, Glass, Atlas, Nexus). Theme cycling (Ctrl+K) and Settings picker now include all 6 themes.

### Improved
- **Premium card depth**: Dark theme cards (Terminal, Midnight, Ember, Nexus Dark) now have subtle box shadows creating layered depth instead of flat rectangles.
- **Progress bar polish**: All progress bars now have rounded ends and a subtle accent-colored glow per theme (green/blue/orange).
- **Bolder status indicators**: Status dots (online/offline/warning) are larger (10px) with colored glow halos for better visibility on dense pages.
- **Theme picker expanded**: Settings appearance panel now shows all 6 themes (was 4) with accurate mini-previews including Nexus Dark and Nexus Light.
- **Layout switcher description**: Nexus layout description updated to "Modern SaaS, flat nav" (was "Light, clean SaaS" which was misleading since dark themes now work with it).

## [2.0.5] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- **Nexus Dark theme**: Premium dark mode for the Nexus layout with sun/moon toggle. GitHub Dark-inspired three-layer depth palette, Inter font, rounded corners, blue accent. Persists across sessions.
- **Sidebar group labels**: Navigation groups (Reseller, Operations, Admin) now display small uppercase labels in the Command layout sidebar.
- **Glass sidebar tooltips**: Native browser tooltips show nav item names when the Glass layout sidebar is collapsed.
- **Card elevation system**: Three elevation levels (`.elevation-1/2/3`), `.card-interactive` hover effects, `.hover-lift` card animations. Applied to dashboard cards, sites table, mail service cards, app templates, server/monitor items.
- **Page header system**: Sticky `page-header` bar with title, subtitle, and action buttons. Applied to 13 pages (Dashboard, Sites, Databases, Apps, Security, Settings, Servers, Mail, Monitoring, DNS, Users, Git Deploy, Alerts).
- **Login background gradient**: Subtle radial gradient that adapts per theme (green/blue/teal/orange).
- **Modal portal system**: `dp-modal` / `dp-modal-overlay` CSS classes for Nexus-compatible modal styling across 15 modals in 6 pages.

### Improved
- **Button color hierarchy**: Only primary CTAs (Create Site, Run Scan, Add Record) stay green. All secondary/utility buttons (Customize, Restart Nginx, Export, Refresh, etc.) use neutral gray — breaks the green monotone across 6 pages, ~25 buttons.
- **Dynamic progress bar colors**: CPU/Memory/Disk bars change from green (<70%) → amber (70-90%) → red (>90%). Disk uses 80/90 thresholds. Rounded ends with smooth 500ms transitions.
- **Dashboard visual hierarchy**: Metric cards with elevation, 24h chart fade-in animation, staggered stat grid, collapsible onboarding wizard (auto-collapses after 3+ steps, persists to localStorage).
- **Sidebar footer redesign**: User avatar circle with initial, hover-reveal logout button, descriptive health status ("Connected"/"Disconnected" replaces "OK"/"!"). Applied to both Command and Glass layouts.
- **Typography for non-terminal themes**: Midnight and Ember now remove uppercase/tracking like Nexus. All 5 sans-serif themes get 15px body text for better Inter readability.
- **Security card grid**: Changed from 5-column with orphan card to balanced 3-column grid with equal `min-h-[140px]` heights.
- **Table hover states**: `table-row-hover` class added to Security, DNS, and Users table rows with theme-aware hover colors.
- **Onboarding wizard**: Completed steps show a solid green circle with white checkmark. Collapsible with compact "Setup: X/5 complete" view.
- **Ember theme contrast**: Lightened surfaces and brightened orange accent for better text readability.
- **Atlas layout nav**: Added `shrink-0` to nav items so they scroll horizontally instead of compressing.
- **Richer empty states**: Sites, Databases, Git Deploys, Monitors, and Crons pages show contextual feature descriptions instead of bare "No X yet" text.
- **Login page**: Removed bulky "Made with Rust" gear icon, replaced with minimal "Powered by Rust" text. Card shadows added.

### Fixed
- **Theme switching: Nexus→Terminal white screen**: Switching from Nexus layout to any other layout left `dp-theme=nexus` (white) active, rendering a white Terminal layout. Fixed with `dp-pre-nexus-theme` save/restore in LayoutSwitcher, NexusLayout, useLayoutState, and main.tsx IIFE.
- **Nexus modal clipping**: Modals in Nexus layout were clipped by `overflow-hidden` on the main wrapper, hiding the top fields. Fixed with `createPortal` to render at `document.body`.
- **Nexus modal contrast**: Modal cards in Nexus light had the same `#f9fafb` background as the page (invisible). Fixed with `dp-modal` class providing white background, strong shadow, and proper text colors.
- **Page header spacing**: Added `margin-bottom: 1.25rem` to `.page-header` for consistent spacing between header and content.
- **Nexus light theme: tinted selection buttons**: Migration source cards, Settings proxy selector, and all `bg-rust-500/10`-style toggle buttons were rendering as solid blue blobs. Fixed with properly unescaped selectors.
- **Nexus light theme: accent toggle visibility**: `bg-accent-500/15` toggles now render with readable blue tint and text.

## [2.0.4] - 2026-03-20

### Security
- **CORS lockdown**: Deny all cross-origin requests by default. Same-origin panel UI is unaffected. Previously defaulted to `AllowOrigin::any()` which allowed CSRF from any website.
- **Constant-time token comparison**: Agent auth middleware now uses `subtle::ConstantTimeEq` to prevent timing attacks on token validation.
- **Token hashing in database**: Agent tokens stored as SHA-256 hashes in `agent_token_hash` column. DB dump no longer exposes plaintext tokens for inbound auth.
- **Token rotation**: New `POST /auth/rotate-token` on agent + `POST /api/servers/{id}/rotate-token` on API. 60-second grace period for old token during rotation. Updates `api.env` on disk for persistence.
- **Secure cookie fix**: `BASE_URL` defaulted to `https://panel.example.com`, causing `Secure` flag on cookies over HTTP. Fixed — defaults to empty, setup script sets from domain.
- **jsonwebtoken upgraded 9 → 10.3.0**: Fixes type confusion vulnerability that could lead to authorization bypass.
- **serde_yml replaced with serde_yaml_ng**: `serde_yml` and `libyml` are unsound/unmaintained. Replaced with `serde_yaml_ng` v0.10.0.

### Fixed
- **Cascade cron cleanup**: Deleting a site now removes cron entries from the system crontab. Previously, DB records were cleaned via CASCADE but crontab entries were orphaned.
- **UFW port gap**: Setup script now adds panel ports (80, 443, 8443) to UFW even when the firewall is pre-existing. Previously skipped port rules if UFW was already installed.
- **Token rotation API→agent desync**: Rotating the agent token now updates the API's in-memory `AgentClient` token AND writes to `api.env` on disk. Previously left the API with the old token, breaking all agent communication.

### Added
- **CI pipeline** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): Rust clippy, frontend type check, build verification, unit tests, `cargo-audit` + `npm audit` security scanning. Runs on every push to main and PRs.
- **E2E test suite** (`tests/e2e.sh`): 62 tests across 27 categories — full CRUD lifecycle, security edge cases, zero-leftover cleanup. Run: `bash tests/e2e.sh <host> [port]`.
- **Deep E2E test suite** (`tests/deep-e2e.sh`): 51 tests for advanced features — WordPress install, backup restore, git deploy, reseller system, file operations, compose stacks, concurrent operations, extensions API.
- **29 unit tests**: Config parsing (BASE_URL defaults, Secure flag logic), token hashing, input validation (domains, names, container IDs, path traversal, pagination).
- **API reference** (`docs/api-reference.md`): 648 lines documenting all 371 endpoints with request bodies and examples.
- **Competitor comparison** (`COMPARISON.md`): Honest comparison vs HestiaCP, CloudPanel, RunCloud, CyberPanel, Ploi.
- **README overhaul**: Dashboard screenshot, comparison table, collapsible screenshot gallery, cleaner structure.
- **FUNDING.yml**: PayPal sponsor link (paypal.me/ovexro).

### Verified
- **Reboot recovery**: All services start automatically after server reboot. 62/62 E2E tests pass post-reboot.
- **Fresh install E2E**: Full install via `INSTALL_FROM_RELEASE=1` on clean Ubuntu 24.04 VPS — all features operational.

## [2.0.3] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- **Documentation site** at `docs.dockpanel.dev`: mdBook-generated, 8 pages (getting-started, troubleshooting, CLI reference, WordPress, Git deploy, email, multi-server, backups). 1855 lines.

### Changed
- **Docker app templates pinned**: 33 of 39 `:latest` tags replaced with specific major versions (e.g., `redis:7`, `ghost:5`, `grafana/grafana:11`). 6 kept at `:latest` due to non-standard versioning (minio, nocodb, etc.).
- **Auto-monitors removed**: Sites no longer auto-create uptime monitors on creation. Users create monitors manually when DNS is configured.

### Added — Documentation
- **8 documentation pages** at `docs/`: getting-started, troubleshooting, CLI reference, and 5 guides (WordPress, Git deploy, email, multi-server, backups). 1855 lines of practical, copy-paste-friendly docs.

### Fixed — Fresh Install E2E (real clean VPS test)
- **Local server not registered after setup**: API returned 503 on all requests after admin creation. Added `ensure_local_server()` call in the setup endpoint.
- **Site docroot missing /public/ subdirectory**: Agent created `/var/www/{domain}/` but nginx expected `/var/www/{domain}/public/`. Fixed to create the correct subdirectory.
- **Backup tar flag incompatibility**: Replaced `--no-dereference` with `-h` (POSIX-compatible).

### Fixed — Comprehensive Audit (57 findings across 7 audit types)

#### Critical
- **Migration ordering**: `whitelabel_oauth` migration was running before `reseller_system` (ALTERing a table before it existed). Renumbered to `20260320050000`.
- **OAuth bypasses 2FA**: OAuth login issued full session without checking `totp_enabled`. Now redirects to 2FA challenge when enabled.
- **Setup script missing build tools**: Fresh VPS source builds failed — added `build-essential cmake pkg-config` installation.
- **No swap on x86_64 low-RAM VPS**: Swap creation only triggered on ARM. Now applies to all architectures when building from source.
- **install-agent.sh wrong env vars**: Remote agents never entered phone-home mode (`AGENT_TOKEN` vs `DOCKPANEL_SERVER_TOKEN`). Fixed to write both sets.
- **Systemd services never updated during upgrade**: `update.sh` now rewrites service files with current `ReadWritePaths` and hardening.
- **Required directories not created during upgrade**: `update.sh` now creates `/etc/postfix`, `/var/vmail`, and other directories needed by new features.

#### High
- **UFW blocks panel port 8443**: IP-based installs now open the configured panel port in UFW.
- **ExecStartPost hardcodes www-data**: Agent socket `chgrp` now auto-detects nginx group (`www-data` or `nginx`).
- **`read` prompt broken in curl-pipe-bash**: Domain prompt now reads from `/dev/tty` when stdin is piped.
- **Frontend path mismatch after upgrade**: `update.sh` now fixes nginx root path when switching between source and release modes.
- **config.rs default LISTEN_ADDR was 0.0.0.0:3000**: Changed to `127.0.0.1:3080` to match all scripts and nginx config.
- **uninstall.sh incomplete cleanup**: Now removes CLI binary, tmpfiles.d, crontab entries, `/var/www/acme`, `/var/lib/dockpanel`.
- **Stacks INSERT missing server_id**: Docker Compose stacks now include `server_id` in INSERT.
- **Staging site INSERT missing server_id**: Staging environments now inherit parent site's server_id.
- **No domain uniqueness across sites + git_deploys**: Cross-table domain conflict check prevents silent hijacking.
- **Blue-green deploy dropped resource limits**: New container now inherits `memory`/`cpu_period`/`cpu_quota` from config.
- **Git preview port has no unique constraint**: Added `UNIQUE INDEX` on `git_previews(host_port)`.
- **Site proxy_port has no unique constraint**: Added partial `UNIQUE INDEX` on `sites(proxy_port)`.
- **No terminal session limit**: Added `AtomicU32` counter with max 20 concurrent PTY sessions.

### Added
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Development setup, architecture overview, code style, PR process.
- **GitHub issue templates**: Bug report and feature request forms with structured fields.
- **GitHub PR template**: Checklist for builds, tests, and changelog.

### Changed
- **README.md**: Added badges (license, release, build), doc links, contributing section, phone-home disclosure.
- **.gitignore**: Added SSL material, database file patterns.

### Fixed — Adversarial Security Pentest
- **Rate limit bypass via X-Forwarded-For**: Login rate limiter now uses `X-Real-IP` (set by nginx, not forgeable) instead of `X-Forwarded-For`.
- **SSRF filter bypass in extensions**: Webhook URL validation replaced string-matching with DNS resolution + `is_loopback()`/`is_private()`/`is_link_local()` checks. Blocks hex IPs, decimal IPs, IPv6 loopback, DNS-to-localhost, cloud metadata.
- **Nginx version disclosure**: Added `server_tokens off` to nginx config.

### Fixed — Disaster Recovery
- **Agent fails after every reboot**: Removed `ReadWritePaths` and `PrivateTmp=yes` from agent systemd service (redundant with `ProtectSystem=no`, and caused NAMESPACE errors for missing dirs). Added `ExecStartPre` to create `/run/dockpanel`.
- **Health endpoint false "ok"**: `/api/health` now checks DB connectivity, returns `"degraded"` when database is unreachable.
- **StartLimitIntervalSec in wrong section**: Moved from `[Service]` to `[Unit]` in all 3 scripts.

### Fixed — UX Walkthrough (fresh VPS testing)
- **Secure cookie over HTTP**: Login cookie conditionally sets `Secure` flag based on `BASE_URL` scheme. `SameSite` changed from `Strict` to `Lax` (Strict blocked OAuth redirects).
- **Site document root not created**: Agent now creates `/var/www/{domain}/public/` with a default `index.html` during site provisioning.
- **PHP site without PHP check**: Agent validates PHP-FPM socket exists before writing PHP nginx config. Returns clear error with install instructions.

### Fixed — Supply Chain
- **`serde_yaml` archived**: Replaced with `serde_yml` in agent and CLI (serde_yaml maintainer archived the crate in 2024).
- **MailHog abandoned**: Replaced `mailhog/mailhog` template with `axllent/mailpit` (MailHog last updated 2020).
- **Stale build templates**: Updated `rust:1.82-slim` → `rust:1.94-slim`, `golang:1.23-alpine` → `golang:1.24-alpine`.

### Fixed — Code Quality
- **Cloudflare auth header deduplication**: 5 inline blocks → shared `helpers::cf_headers()`.
- **Server IP detection deduplication**: 6 inline blocks → shared `helpers::detect_public_ip()`.
- **Agent semaphore split**: Long-running ops (Docker builds) use separate 5-permit semaphore, quick requests keep 20.
- **Extension webhook rate limiting**: Max 20 concurrent deliveries with atomic counter.
- **DB pool acquire timeout**: 5-second timeout prevents indefinite blocking.
- **Uptime monitor N+1 query**: Maintenance window check batched into single query.

## [2.0.2] - 2026-03-20

### Changed
- **Version alignment**: All Cargo.toml and package.json versions bumped to 2.0.2 (were 0.1.0/1.0.0). API health endpoint and CLI --version now report correct version.
- **Binary size claims**: Marketing site, README, and FAQ updated from "~20MB" (agent-only) to "~35MB" (total of agent + API + CLI) for honest comparison.
- **Template count**: FAQ corrected from 53 to 54 app templates.
- **OS support**: Hero section now includes Rocky Linux 9+ alongside other supported distros.

### Fixed
- **install-agent.sh binary naming**: Was downloading `dockpanel-agent-x86_64` / `dockpanel-agent-aarch64` but GitHub Releases publishes `dockpanel-agent-linux-amd64` / `dockpanel-agent-linux-arm64`. Fixed to match release naming.
- **install-agent.sh apt-get hardcoding**: Now detects package manager (apt/dnf/yum) instead of hardcoding apt-get. CentOS, Rocky, Fedora, and Amazon Linux now supported for remote agent installs.
- **install-agent.sh server-id persistence**: `--server-id` was accepted but never written to config. Now persisted to `/etc/dockpanel/api.env` as `SERVER_ID`.
- **install-agent.sh tmpfiles.d**: Added `/run/dockpanel` tmpfiles.d entry so socket directory survives reboots.
- **install-agent.sh systemd hardening**: Remote agent service now matches local agent hardening (MemoryMax, LimitNOFILE, PrivateTmp, ProtectKernelLogs/Modules).
- **update.sh pre-built binary path**: Added `INSTALL_FROM_RELEASE=1` support so ARM users who installed via release binaries can update without Rust toolchain.
- **update.sh redundant health check**: Removed duplicate wait-for-health loop after rollback-capable check.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-19
