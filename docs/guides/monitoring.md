# Monitoring & Alerting

## Monitors

Monitors check whether your services are reachable. Arcpanel supports four active monitor types and a passive heartbeat type.

| Type | How it works |
|------|-------------|
| **HTTP** | Sends a GET request and checks the status code. Follows up to 5 redirects. 30s timeout. |
| **TCP** | Opens a TCP connection to a host and port. 10s timeout. |
| **Ping** | Sends an ICMP ping to a hostname or IP. |
| **Keyword** | HTTP check that also verifies the response body contains (or does not contain) a specific string. |
| **Heartbeat** | Dead man's switch -- expects periodic pings from your app. If a ping is missed, the monitor goes down. |

### Creating a Monitor

1. Go to **Monitors** in the sidebar
2. Click **Create Monitor**
3. Fill in:
   - **Name**: A descriptive label (e.g., `Production API`)
   - **URL**: The endpoint to check (e.g., `https://api.example.com/health`)
   - **Type**: HTTP, TCP, Ping, Keyword, or Heartbeat
   - **Check Interval**: How often to check, in seconds (default: 60)
   - **Port** (TCP only): The port number to connect to
   - **Keyword** (Keyword only): The string to match, and whether it must or must not be present
   - **Custom Headers** (HTTP/Keyword): Optional JSON object of headers to include in requests
   - **Alert Email**: Toggle email notifications on down/recovery
   - **Slack/Discord URL**: Webhook URL for chat notifications
4. Click **Create**

### From the CLI

```bash
arc monitors create --name "My Site" --url https://example.com --interval 300
```

### Monitor Status

Each monitor tracks:

- **Status**: `up` or `down`
- **Response Time**: Milliseconds for the last check
- **Last Status Code**: HTTP status code (HTTP/Keyword monitors)
- **Last Checked**: Timestamp of the most recent check

Check history is kept for 24 hours and then purged automatically.

### Maintenance Windows

When a maintenance window is active for a user, their monitors are skipped. No checks run and no alerts fire during the window. Schedule maintenance from the panel to suppress false alarms during planned downtime.

### Heartbeat Monitors (Dead Man's Switch)

1. Create a heartbeat monitor in the panel
2. Copy the unique URL: `POST /api/heartbeat/{monitor_id}/{token}`
3. Add a cron job or scheduled task in your application to ping this URL
4. If the expected interval passes without a ping, the monitor goes down

No authentication is required for heartbeat pings.

## Alert Rules

Alert rules define thresholds for server-level conditions. Configure them under **Alerts** > **Rules**.

### Available Alert Types

| Alert | What it watches | Default threshold |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| **CPU** | CPU usage exceeds threshold for N minutes | 90% for 5 min |
| **Memory** | Memory usage exceeds threshold for N minutes | 90% for 5 min |
| **Disk** | Disk usage exceeds threshold | 85% |
| **Server Offline** | Server stops reporting metrics | 2 min heartbeat timeout |
| **SSL Expiry** | SSL certificate approaching expiration | Warns at 30, 14, 7, 3, 1 days |
| **Service Health** | Nginx, PHP-FPM, MySQL, PostgreSQL down | Checked every 2 min |
| **Backup Failure** | A scheduled backup fails | Immediate |
| **Container Health** | Docker container unhealthy or crash-looping | Checked every 2 min |

You can set rules globally (apply to all servers) or per-server to override global defaults.

### Cooldown

After an alert fires, it will not fire again for the configured cooldown period (default: 60 minutes). This prevents notification spam during sustained incidents.

### Muted Types

You can mute specific alert types from external notifications (Slack, Discord, etc.) while still recording them in the panel. Set a comma-separated list of types to suppress in the alert rules.

## Notification Channels

Configure where alerts are sent under **Alerts** > **Rules**.

| Channel | Configuration |
|---------|---------------|
| **Email** | Toggle on/off. Uses the SMTP settings from Settings. |
| **Slack** | Paste a Slack incoming webhook URL. |
| **Discord** | Paste a Discord webhook URL. |
| **PagerDuty** | Enter your PagerDuty Events API v2 integration key. |
| **Generic Webhook** | Any URL. Receives a JSON POST with alert details. |

All webhook URLs are validated against SSRF -- internal/private IP addresses are rejected.

## Alert Escalation

If a firing alert is not acknowledged within 15 minutes, the alert engine re-sends notifications. Escalation repeats every 30 minutes until the alert is acknowledged or resolved.

To stop escalation, go to **Alerts** and click **Acknowledge** on the alert.

## Alert Lifecycle

An alert moves through three states:

1. **Firing** -- The condition is active. Notifications are sent.
2. **Acknowledged** -- A user acknowledged it. Escalation stops.
3. **Resolved** -- The condition cleared (automatically or manually).

Resolved alerts are purged after 30 days.

## Smart Alerting

### Response Time Degradation

If an HTTP monitor returns a successful status but the response time exceeds 5000ms, a `slow_response` warning alert is created. This catches performance degradation before full downtime.

### Auto-Incidents

When a monitor goes down, Arcpanel automatically creates a managed incident for the public status page. When the monitor recovers, the incident is auto-resolved. Status page subscribers are notified of both transitions.

### Disk-Full Forecast

The alert engine tracks disk usage over time. If the trend projects the disk will be full within 48 hours, a warning alert fires -- giving you time to act before it becomes critical.

### Memory Leak Detection

If memory usage has risen more than 10% over the past hour and is currently above 60%, a `memory_leak` warning alert fires. This is based on comparing recent 10-minute averages against 20-minute-old averages from the metrics history.

### Docker Container Monitoring

Every 2 minutes, the alert engine checks all Docker containers on the server:

- **Unhealthy**: Containers with a failing health check trigger an alert.
- **Crash-loop**: If the auto-healer restarts a service 3 times in 30 minutes and it keeps failing, it stops retrying and creates an incident.

## SSL Certificate Dashboard

The certificate dashboard shows all SSL certificates across your sites with expiry dates. Certificates expiring within the configured warning window (default: 30, 14, 7, 3, 1 days) trigger alerts. Arcpanel auto-renews Let's Encrypt certificates. The dashboard helps you spot custom certificates that need manual renewal.
